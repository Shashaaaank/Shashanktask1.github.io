      <p>
        The crisis is an opportunity to rethink how tourism interacts with our 
        societies, other economic sectors and our natural resources and ecosystems;
         to measure and manage it better; to ensure a fair distribution of its 
         benefits and to advance the transition towards a carbon neutral and resilient tourism economy.

        The brief provides recommendations in five priority areas to cushion 
        the massive impacts on lives and economies and to rebuild a tourism 
        with people at the center. It features examples of governments support 
        to the sector, calls for a reopening that gives priority to the health 
        and safety of the workers, travelers and host communities 
        and provides a roadmap to transform tourism.<br />
        The recent coronavirus (COVID-19) has triggered a concern worldwide in
         early January 2020, and by the end of March 2020, the outbreak has infected
          several people globally (WHO, 2020). The severity of the pandemic may be
           assessed based on the figures of the past epidemics such as SARS, Spanish 
           Flu, etc. Tourism and hospitality businesses are profoundly affected by 
           COVID-19 that has been declared as pandemic on 12th March 2020 (WHO, 2020).<br />
           <br /> 
           Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the travel and tourism industry's employment 
           loss is predicted to be 100.08 Million worldwide (Statista, 2020). The 
           pandemic has not only affected economically but as well as politically 
           and socially (Cohen, 2012). As the number of infected cases rising throughout 
           the nation, and with the implementation of certain measures and campaigns 
           like social distancing, community lockdowns, work from home, stay at home, 
           self- or mandatory-quarantine, curbs on crowding, etc., pressure is created 
           for halting the tourism industry/business (Gretzel et al., 2020; Sigala, 2020). 
           This change in the current system has led to the beginning of the recession 
           and depression, seeking a transformational change in society. According to 
           Liu et al. (2019), the most dynamic sector is the tourism industry that 
           benefits many other sectors like lodging, catering, transportation, retail, 
           entertainment, etc. contributing to economic growth and recovery globally. 
           It has been reported that tourism growth has outperformed the world GDP 
           growth record from the past consecutively from the year 2011–2017 (WTTC, 2018). 
           Furthermore, it has been estimated that there is a drop of international 
           tourists of about 78%, causing a loss in export revenue of US$ 1.2 trillion 
           and representing the largest decline in the tourism job cuts, which is about 
           seven times the impact of the 9/11 incident (UNWTO, 2020). Additionally, the 
           drop in the tourists’ demand has led to severe financial problems (Tsionas, 2020).<br />

        India is one of the developing nations known for its uniqueness in its tradition, 
        culture and unparalleled hospitality. It is a major destination for many international 
        tourists, creating several employment opportunities and generating enormous taxes 
        (Ahmed & Krohn, 1992). The Indian tourism industry can be divided into three major 
        segments, such as (i) international inbound tourism; (ii) domestic tourism; and (iii) 
        outbound tourism. The Indian tourism industry has created about 87.5 million jobs, 
        with 12.75% of total employment, thereby contributing INR 194 billion to India’s 
        GDP (WTTC, 2018). Moreover, the sector recorded a 3.2% growth from 2018, with 10.8 
        million foreign tourists arriving in India with a foreign exchange earning of USD 29.9 
        billion in 2019. In this regard, India ranked 8th with respect to total direct travel 
        and contribution towards tourism of about USD 108 billion (FICCI, 2020). Also, 
        there is a 66.4% decline in overseas tourists’ arrivals in India in March 2020 
        compared to last year (TAN, 2020). It has been estimated that there will be about 
        40 million direct and indirect job losses in India, with an annual loss in revenue 
        of around USD 17 billion in India (FICCI, 2020; Scroll, 2020).

        Tourism is a major source of revenue and employment in many countries. It is a 
        generator for employment, income, tax collections and foreign exchange earnings. 
        The tourism industry became highly competitive; hence, accurate tourism demand 
        forecasting is important to make an appropriate strategic and operational decision. 
        Strategic decisions are planning for opening attractions, modes of transport, 
        accommodation, and tourism promotion for which colossal investment is required. 
        In contrast, operational decisions are the number of parking areas, attendants, 
        number of shuttle buses, hours of service per day, and employees’ hiring. 
        Accurate tourism demand forecasting is a challenging task. Forecasting tourism 
        demand help to identify the future pattern which guides planning and policy formation. 
        Forecasting plays a crucial role in tourism planning (Cho, 2001). Moreover, accurate 
        orecasting helps managers and practitioners make appropriate decisions in policy-making, 
        staff and capacity utilization and management, resource management, pricing 
        strategies, etc. during disruption to reduce the risk and uncertainty. Hence, 
        tourism forecasting is one of the significant areas of research.
