        New York has so many names! Concrete Jungle, Big Apple, the City That 
        Never Sleeps and many more. It has been depicted in the movies, books and 
        songs have been written about it. Many believe that New York is the place 
        where one can live the life of the dreams, as it offers so many opportunities. 
        New York has a special way of entangling you. I have been there in every 
        season of the year, and every time I thought – 
        What is New York City? It is the most populous city in the United States, 
        also called the melting pot due to so many different people living here and 
        so many languages spoken (800!). Is it just like in the movies? Some aspects 
        certainly are! New Yorkers really do drink that much coffee, it’s estimated 
        that they consume seven times more coffee than any average American! It’s also 
        the city of contrasts, as I don’t think I have ever seen so many homeless 
        people anywhere else in the States for maybe except in Florida. Still, every 
        20th inhabitant of New York is a millionaire.

        What I like the most about New York is the feeling of freedom I have there. 
        You can wear anything and no one will even stare at you or say something unkind. 
        You are more likely to hear something like “cut dress” when walking in the park.
        Would I like to live here? Probably not, but I certainly like to visit, and 
        this city offers so many options for entertainment as no other!<br />
