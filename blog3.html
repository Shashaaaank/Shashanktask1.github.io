        Everyone has a dream place which they wish to visit once in life. 
        Some people get the chance to fulfill their dream trip, while for some 
        it remains only a dream. I also have a dream to visit a place, which I wish 
        could visit at least once in my lifetime.  I wish I could feel and learn 
        about the people, place, and things of that particular place. For me, my 
        dream vacation is in Italy, especially VENICE.  I heard about this place 
        in my geography book when I was in school. When I got to know that Venice is 
        a city on water, I was very curious and exited to know more about it.

        Venice is one of the most notorious travel destinations in Europe. It is a 
        floating city of waterways and gondolas. Itâ€™s a truly fantastic destination with 
        magnificent architecture.  I would like to swim through the Grand Canal and watch 
        the dazzling water in the moon light. I would love to ride on the water bus and 
        take a quick tour through the beautiful city. I have never been in a gondola. 
        I would like to drift through the canals in a gondola surrounded by aqua-green 
        water. It would be really interesting to hear from the gondolier, the incredible 
        history about the places as I pass through different places on the gondola. 
        Riding on the gondola underneath the breathtaking and iconic Rialto Bridge built 
        with marbles, I would like to explore the true splendor of its design. Exploring 
        the magnificent architecture of the buildings in Venice will be quite interesting. 
        I would like visit the great attractions like The Saint Mark Basilica and Saint Mark
        Square. I would love to see the entire city from top of the beautiful tower, Saint Markâ€™s 
        Campanile. It would be really fun to watch the entire city floating in the 
        Mediterranean Sea. Roaming through the beautiful museum of the Dogeâ€™s Palace and 
        enjoying the artistic beauty of the place would be amazing experience.  I want to 
        spend hours exploring the rich history of the palace. I got to know about these 
        wonderful and unique places in Venice by reading the travel experience of Escape 
        Hunter, the anonymous traveler who wrote â€˜Veniceâ€™s look, feel and smellsâ€™ based on his real experiences.
