        With traditional Japanese architecture that looks great in all types of weather, 
        plus a year-round calendar of festivals and a sophisticated food scene, it's 
        almost always a good time to visit Kyoto. Here's our guide on when to go.
        One of Kyoto's prettiest times of year is also one of its busiest. In spring, 
        the city erupts in the pale-pink blossoms of Yoshino cherries and the darker, 
        bubblegum-colored petals of the shidare-zakura (weeping cherry). It's a sight to 
        behold, and crowds descend on Kyoto's sublime gardens to witness the ephemeral 
        event. If you decide to visit during peak season, you should either be strategic 
        about where you go or willing to bear the brunt of crowds.</br>

        Accommodation at this time is at its most expensive. 
        Expect to pay top rates for everything from atmospheric ryokan (traditional 
        Japanese inns) to chic boutiques to budget hostels.
        No doubt about it, this is festival season in Kyoto. The summer calendar 
        is packed with major events like Gion Matsuri (July), in which huge wooden 
        floats roll through Downtown Kyoto, and small celebrations such as Takeiri-eshiki 
        (Bamboo-cutting Ritual) at Kurama-dera, which has local men donning warrior 
        monk costumes and competing to cut bamboo poles. The summer weather is hot 
        and muggy in Kyoto, but the city's verdant gardens, such as the one around 
        Gi≈ç-ji, are at their best just after a summer rainstorm. </br>
        The heat and humidity 
        keeps the crowds away, but accommodation rates can spike 
        around key events and festivals.
